## üîç Overview of Work

### 1. Hessenberg Reduction  
- Implemented `to_hessenberg(A)` function for reduction of arbitrary square matrices to upper Hessenberg form using Householder reflectors.  
- Verified correctness via numerical residuals $‚ÄñA - QHQ^*‚Äñ$ and $‚ÄñQ^*Q - I‚Äñ$ on symmetric and non-symmetric matrices of various sizes.  
- Benchmarked execution times across matrix sizes from 10 to 10,000, observing expected computational complexity and speed-ups for symmetric matrices.

### 2. Orthogonal Matrices and Eigenvalue Algorithms  
- Analyzed eigenvalues of orthogonal matrices, showing all lie on the unit circle and implications for power iteration and inverse iteration convergence.  
- Explicitly computed eigenvalues of 2x2 orthogonal blocks analytically.  
- Generated random orthogonal matrices via QR factorization, reduced to Hessenberg form, and computed eigenvalues of bottom-right blocks.  
- Explored QR iteration with fixed shifts using these eigenvalues, assessing convergence behavior.
